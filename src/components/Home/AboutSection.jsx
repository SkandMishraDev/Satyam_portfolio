                            Hi, I'm <strong>Satyam</strong>, a passionate backend developer with a knack for turning complex problems into efficient solutions. With experience in various programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy building robust and scalable applications that power the digital world.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-2">
                            My journey in tech began with an interest in how things work behind the scenes. Over the years, I have honed my skills in server-side technologies, database management, and API development, constantly striving to improve and adapt to new challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community. I believe in continuous learning and the power of collaboration to drive innovation.
